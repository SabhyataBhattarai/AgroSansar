# AgroSansar

AgroSansar is a bilingual agriculture advisory platform developed as a semester project.  
It provides farmers with information on crops, weather updates, and general farming guidance.

## Features

- **Bilingual Interface:** Supports Nepali and English.  
- **Farming Tips:** Simple keyword-based algorithm to answer basic farming questions.  
- **Weather Information:** Displays up-to-date weather info for five different regions.  
- **Lightweight & Modular:** Backend and chatbot code organized for easy understanding.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend and Backend:** C# .NET Framework   
- **Chatbot/NLP:** Simple keyword-matching logic  
- **APIs:** Weather API integration  

This project reflects my interest for NLP and AI, at a beginner level. While the current implementation is super simple, it demonstrates my ability to structure code, integrate APIs, and build a functional platform within a week. I am curious to learn more about advanced AI/NLP techniques and contribute to real-world applications.

## Notes

- This is a simple semester project and a learning exercise.  
- I am continuously improving my skills and plan to expand this project with more advanced NLP features.
